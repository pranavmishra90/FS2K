    "1. Load your project from yesterday with the CD45 classifier. If you did not finish the classifier, you can download and [open](./Session%2004-%20Cell%20Detection.ipynb#Sharing-and-downloading-QuPath-projects) \"Proj1 - Session 7\" from the [Backup Projects folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XMvFo3PGXJtyDY6ss6mxvmYL2Shtr60e). This has all of the cells, measurements, annotations, and classifiers we made yesterday. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Immediately save a copy of the project. We will delete some cells and the classifier training annotations and want to keep the option of recalling them later.\n",
    "    1. Go to your project folder, go one level up, and then copy-paste the entire project.\n",
    "        <img src=\"Images/FindProjectFolder.gif\">\n",
    "    2. Name the new copy \"V1_InstanSeg_All\" or similar. When saving copies of projects like this, it is important to give it a *meaningful* name. I recommend including a version number, date, and short identifying information. RESIST THE URGE to leave it as \"- Copy\". This is an actual example of one study's organizational scheme on my computer. I came to regret this immensely - do better than I did.  <br>\n",

It also means that when we're training for subsets below, we can focus the classifier on CD45+ cells and don't have to worry about training it to recognize non-immune cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The tumor annotation will be useful later, but for now it is visually distracting. To hide it without deleting it, select the Tumor class in the Annotation tab and press <kbd>Space Bar</kbd>. "

    "6. [Annotate examples](./Session%2006%20-%20Classifying%20Cells%20pt1.ipynb#3.-Finding-Leukocytes---Training-an-ML-Object-Classifier) of CD4, CD8, and double negative cells. \n",
    "    - For the negative cells, use the *'Ignore&ast;'* class\n",

You will need to re-enable the Hoechst and AF channel measurements at the top if you do this. Creating regular expressions is one way to make use of chatbots, as they can be very convoluted to work with from memory!<br>\n",
    "9. In the log, there will be a new feature weight list. The relevant features will be weighted more heavily. This is a good \"sanity check\" on your classifier\n",
