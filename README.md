## Prepare for the workshop

### Introductory video
Please watch this short video which introduces some QuPath concepts and has some information on installation issues.<br>
![SoonToCreate!](www.youtubevideo.doesn'texistyet)<br>

### Version of QuPath we will be using: 0.6.0RC3
Make sure to install this ahead of time, as some companies/institutes/hospitals **require administrator access** to download and set up QuPath.<br>
[Get it here!](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases)<br>
