# From Samples to Knowledge 2025 Repo
Jupyter notebooks for teaching QuPath - Feb 2025, QuPath v0.6.0rc3<br>
Hosted by [The Microscopy and Histology Core Facilities at La Jolla Institute](https://www.lji.org/research/research-services/microscopy-histology/)<br>
Sara McArdle<br>
Zbigniew Mikulski<br>
and
Michael Nelson of [LOCI](https://loci.wisc.edu/)

## Ask questions in the image.sc forum thread!
We ask that the majority of questions be directed to the [image.sc forum thread here](https://forum.image.sc/t/question-thread-from-samples-to-knowledge-2025/108739), where it will be easiest for all of the hosts to respond to questions and issues as they have time.<br>
If you are interested in keeping up with the topic, make sure to create an image.sc forum profile, and set the post to "Watching" - which will send a notification email whenever there is a new post.<br><Br>

## Prepare for the workshop

### Introductory video
Please watch this short video which introduces some QuPath concepts and has some information on installation issues.<br>
[![Introduction video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vl9V5PxOQIc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Vl9V5PxOQIc)<br>

### Install QuPath: we will be using: 0.6.0RC3
Make sure to install QuPath **ahead of time**, as some companies/institutes/hospitals <span style="color:red">**require administrator access**</span> to download and set up QuPath.<br>
[Get it here!](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases)<br>
<img src= "Images/downloadQuPath.PNG" width="500"><br>

### Download your data and scripts!
If you wait until you arrive, you will be competing with everyone else for bandwidth!<br>
[Download the files from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1t5DtJriZdPpNpuVJBMACkN3Ra16QUjKu)<br>
<img src= "Images/downloadMaterials.PNG" width="500"><br>
See steps 1 and 2 in Session 1 to create your first project!<br>

### Download the Warpy extension and InstanSeg models
Install [the Warpy extension](https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-warpy) into your copy of QuPath 0.6.0<br>
[Warpy download here](https://github.com/biop/qupath-extension-warpy/releases)<br>
There will be a number of .jar files - drag them into an open QuPath window to install, or create an Extensions folder in QuPath's *Preferences* <kbd>Edit > Preferences > Extensions</kbd> and place them in that folder.<br><br><br>
Instructions for InstanSeg setup can be found by scrolling down to [Method 2- One Time Setup, here.](https://github.com/saramcardle/FS2K/blob/main/Session%204-%20Cell%20Detection.ipynb)<br>
