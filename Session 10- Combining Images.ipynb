    "Because it's open-source and popular, many people within the QuPath community write additional functionality for QuPath in the form of extension that can be downloaded separately. Let's try installing one of my favorites- WarpyImageCombiner. This comes from the [BioImaging and Optics Platform](https://www.epfl.ch/research/facilities/ptbiop/) through the EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland. "

    "1. Close the HE image (on the left). `Right click on it > Multi-view > Close viewer`.\n",
    "2. Remove the now empty viewer. `Right click on the Overlay image > Multi-view > Set grid size > Grid 1 x 1 (single viewer)`\n",

    "    - You can probably match most nuclei across images, but there will be some that don't match well and some that are misaligned.\n",
    "    - You also lose resolution in the HE image, because the new pixel size is 0.325. If you had switched which image was the \"base\", you *would not have gained resolution*. QuPath would interpolate between fluorescence pixels to match the pixel sizes, but it cannot create information that wasn't in the original image. \n",
    "4. This new project entry does not duplicate the large image files! It is reading both .ome.tif files simultaneously and applying the transform on-the-fly. Simply viewing the image is memory intensity (but not storage intensive). If you intend to do any deep processing on this image, I recommend you save it as an .ome.tif in its own right. \n",
