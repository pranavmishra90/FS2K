    "When analyzing spatial relationships, *detections* are characterized by their centroids while *annotations* are characterized by their boundaries. To determine if macrophages are plausibly touching T cells, we need to measure distance from the macrophage boundaries. Therefore, we need to create annotations around the macrophage. There are two ways to do this:\n",

    "Since tingible body macrophages are predominantly found in the germinal center in tonsils, and they are the dominant CD11c+ CD68+ cells in the germinal centers,  we can skip the entire object classifier step and directly segment GC cells found by our pixel classifier as TB Mac annotations.\n",

If these are the cells of interest, than you want to use Option 1, which finds cells regardless of location. If these are definitionally not the cells we care about, then restricting the region to GCs improves accuracy and makes us less likely to miss small cells. \n",
